# Tiktok video scraper

This project scrapes the TikTok website and gives a list of all videos that a user has seen on their feed. 
The `Scraper` folder is the latest version. 

## Part I
Open your web browser and add the Scraper extension, to it. It will load all the scripts to your browser and then you can go to your TikTok website, log in, and switch on the extension. You'll find a file of all the video links that you've watched with metadata too!

## Part II
downloadScripting is used to run through all the video links obtained from Part I and download them on your local computer.
